granular data or atomic data - подробная разбитая на все поля. Allow the same data to be examined in different ways.

most basic information:
- who are the best customers

* BI VS BW
SAP BW as a part of a business intelligence solution.
BI stands for  evolution of informational processing as example of business process reengineering evolution.
Data warehouse is a solution in increasing amount of business information for efficient decision-making processes.
* History
master file -> database -> online apps & central online database
batch -> online transaction processing

Extract file - exctracted by one app from database and shipped to another app.

Lot of them - spiderweb problem. Realization that there were different data - *operational* ( daily operations of a business) and
*informational*.

Decision support system (DSS)  

Operational processing was done out of an ERP systems like SAP. Information processing was done out of a data warehouse.
* Data Warehouse
It eveolvs from these requirements and supports the process of moving data from source systems, transforming and cleansing so that it
may be stored in a integrated data model at an atomic level of granularity. Consist of tables or databases.
 - Subject-oriented :: process or object. subject area databases for customer, material, vendor, transaction.
 - Integrated :: data from various subject areas should be rationalized with one another.
 - Nonvolatile :: no change for record
 - Time-variant :: A record is accurate only as of some moment in time.
 - Created for pyrpose of management decisions :: 

Provides data:
 - Detailed or granular
 - Integrated
 - Historical
 - Easy-access

* Data Model
- design of data warehouse.
At highest level, the data model is an *Entry relationship diagram(ERD)* - represents only granular data and no derived data.
*ERD* - consist of _Entities_ and relationships. 
Entities is futher detailed in *data item set(DIS)* - keys and attributes and futher at *physical design* for database management system.
*physical aspects* - partitioning, loading, indexing, storage media, timestamping.

One table relates to another by means of shared key or foreign key relationship.
Table represent *subject area* or subset of *subject area*.
 - Customer
 - Product    [ˈprɒdʌkt]
 - Shipment [ˈʃɪpmənt]
 - Vendor     [ˈvɛndɔː] продавец
 - Order       [ˈɔːdə]

It is patently a mistake to build the data warehouse in an all-at-once or "big bang" approach.

*Extract/transfer/load ETL* software - create interface to bring the data into the world of data warehouse.
In SAP BW it is so-called _Staging Engine_ to perform simple transformation and conversion.

* Timestamping
Two ways that record is stored in the data warehouse:
| discretely                                      | continuously      |
|-------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
| june 14                                         | jan 1 to jan 13   |
| one instan in time for which record is accurate | span of time fo.. |

Record in a data warehouse have a distinctive характерную structure:
- timestamp
- key
- Primary data
- Secondary data

Data relationship in warehouse is specific - it limited by the timestams found on the participating records.(not like _referential integrity_)

* Generic data vs Specific data
Generic data - applies to all instances of a subject area.
Specific data - applies to only certain occurrences of a subject area.
* Data quality
most data quality activity occurs at ELT.
Over time data changes. there is need for periodic adjustment of data based on changes in business conditions that have occured over time.

dormancy ration 10 20 % is ok.
dormant data grossly hurts performance.
Data that is inactive is placed in a physically separate facility - alternative storage or ner-line storage.
This tech calls *cross-media storage manager(CMSM)* - sites between main storage and alternative.

* Meta Data
Roles:
 - describe what data resides
 - coordinator between different services from ELT to information access.

Types:
 - Technical meta data :: describe the structure and content of the different types of data. Stored for long time.
 - Operational meta data :: is the metrics that are generated by the day-to-day. Metrics such
   * records passed from one software component to anather
   * length of operation of a program
   * number of records in a database, etc.
 - Business meta data :: business definitions, business formulae, and business conditions.

One  concern is the integrity of meta data:
- certain protocol for meta data is necessary.
- each unit of meta data must have one owner. Owner has the right of update, creation and deletion of unit of meta data. Everyone else
  becomes a sharer of the meta data. As meta data is passed from one node to the next, track of ownership must be kept.

 * Warehouse concept
database theory - all data be gathered into single database.
data warehouse - different kinds of databases for different purposes. 1) Operational transaction processing 2) Informational prcessing
The data warehouse called for data to be integrated and stored in physically separate database techs.
*Data marts* (витрины данных) - grew from data warehouses.

At the center was Data warehouse which provided granular data that was reshaped int omany different forms in order to feed the many
different forms of decision support processing.
*Corporate information factory(CIF)* - architectural framework. 
CIF is like city plan:
Apps -> ELT -> ODS, DataWarehouse -> data marts, data mining, crm, eComm, Bus In.

CIF was In the same time that SAP and Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) were developed.
SAP BW uses CIF.

Data Warehouse becomes the support infrastructure for business intelligence.


* CHAPTER 2 
SAP has been developing software according to *solution map*.  More or less SAP has evolved from ERP to e-business software solutions
company covering areas as CRM, supply chain optimization, business intelligence.

SAP BW First release 1998.

SAP BI solution. Two main components: The Enterprise Portal and SAP BW.

Business process re-engineering (BPR) is a _ business management strategy_, originally pioneered in the early 1990s.

Why we need separate storage?:
 - ERP apps were not designed to store history.
 - Often only some of the apps are ERP based. In this case there is still  a need for integration.
 - tech optimal for ERP is optimized on the efficient running of transcations. Informational processing does not run well on this kind
   of tech; the predictable processes are found in the transaction-processing world, while unpredictable requests are made in analysis
   world.
 - ERP have thousand of tables in a highly normalized schema that may be difficult to access and to make available to the informational
   analyst.
 - ERP require their own processing windows for real-time information, while informational processing may tolerate latency
** HISTORY OF SAP BW
First in SAP R/3 release 2.0. To obtain reports easier created at *information system layer* within SAP R/3 product. Different Query
tools in applications.

In the early 1990s SAP implemented *Online analytic processing(OLAP)* - *research processor* was used in CO-PA. Today it is *Drill-Down
Reporting*

Then _reporting server_ was created - *SAP Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW)* most concepts was ported from SAP R/3.

Until SAP BW 3.0, SAP had not created a complete solution to address components of CIF. (Open Information Warehouse, R/3-based Data
Warehouse, ALE-based Data Warehouse)

SAP BW software component is delivered with nearly every solution sold by SAP.
*SAP BI solution* contains  the Enterprise Portal and  the SAP BW. Both create foundation on which to build collaborative analytic apps.

** Architecture
Applications: Directory Services (LDAP) - separate
Enterprise portal: Text Retrival, Classification Taxonomy, Indexing. Main - Unification Services. ((Apps && Unstructured information)) 
*SAP BW*: Presentation, Analysis/Access, Storage, ELT. Main - Master Data services, Administration Services. ((Structured Information))

SAP BW v1.2a was a bit ahead of its time.
*InfoCube and OLAP engine* - access and analyze data. base.
*operational data store (ODS) layer* for creating data warehouse
