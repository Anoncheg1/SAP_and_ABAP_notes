REUSE_ALV_DISPLAY_GRID

2000 year   CL_GUI_ALV_GRID - replacer, could make some of the columns, or even individual cells, editable

 7.20? CL_SALV_TABLE -  dynamically generating the field catalogue based on an internal table.  Problem to make column or cell editable.
- Wrapper around CL_GUI_ALV_GRID, adding some features, and clearly subtracting others


 Use the CL_SALV_TABLE to generate the field catalogue dynamically, and then pass that field catalogue into CL_GUI_ALV_GRID. There have been some articles on the SCN about that also!!!!
